                    The Flat Earth Society is a group actively promoting the Flat Earth Movement worldwide. Descending
                    from Samuel
                    Shenton's International Flat Earth Research Society, and the universal Zetetic Society before it, we
                    continue the
                    age-old tradition of questioning the Round Earth doctrine and challenging authorities.

                    <p>
                        Samuel Shenton, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Royal Geographic Society, founded
                        the Flat Earth Society in 1956, after renaming it from the Universal Zetetic Society. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He led the
                        Flat Earth Society from its founding in 1956 until his death in 1971, at which time leadership
                        passed to Charles K. Johnson. Shenton collected material, gave lectures and generated publicity for
                        the Society so that by his death in 1971 the Society had over 100 members. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Flat Earth beliefs have had a notable recent resurgence since 2015. Since 2017, there are
                        now over 500 members.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Drawing from the society's founder, Samuel Shenton, our goal is to foster a community where we can discuss and challenge the mainstream scientific understanding the the Earth's shape.

                    Our FAQ was created to address the many misconceptions a Round Earther may have about the Flat Earth
                    Theory, and to act as an easily-accessible entry point into the mainstream Flat Earth model. This
                    page is designed to answer some of the questions that many Round Earthers raise when they first
                    arrive. Please check this page before making your first threads in the forums, as it may contain the
                    answers to the questions on your mind.
